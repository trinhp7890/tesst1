        "default": "Vegetable oils and fats are good emollients, due to their lipophilic nature. These compounds efficiently prevent transepidermal water loss, because of their excellent occlusive properties. A number of studies have demonstrated that the higher the saturation degree of a certain oil, the lower its viscosity and the better its skin penetration. Because of this property, these compounds are assumed to facilitate oil penetration into the skin, thus helping improve the skin. Because of these reasons, sunflower oil is highly recommendable to formulate cosmetic products with moisturizing and emollient activities."
